# ðŸš— AI Car Simulation
An AI-powered self-driving car simulation using Python and NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be trained to autonomously navigate a car in a 2D simulated environment.

## ðŸ“– Introduction
This AI Car Simulation project uses a neuroevolution algorithm (NEAT) to train cars to drive themselves in a virtual 2D environment. The AI agents learn to avoid obstacles and navigate complex tracks through generations of evolution without any hardcoded driving logic.
